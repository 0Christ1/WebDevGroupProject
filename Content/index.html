      <h2>LOVE NET ART</h2>
      <img src="Screenshot 2023-10-18 at 1.27.37 AM.png" />
      <p>
        LOVE by GROUP Z is a net art series experimenting with love and intimacy
        within the virtual space. The layout consists of seven stories linked
        together in a non-linear HTML file format, where images, texts,
        interactive components, and hyperlinks express the different aspects of
        love. Because of the overdone nature of love and intimacy as a subject
        of artistic interpretations, the work stands out through its creative
        use of the web structure. When analyzing this focus on material, it is
        important to consider the context of web spaces as an emerging reality
        during this time.

        <h2>Consequences of Isolation</h2>
        <p>
          Why is loneliness so closely linked to our health? Recently,
          scientists have been testing specific neurons in mice brains called
          dorsal raphe nucleus or DRN. Accidentally, they were able to see the
          effects of social isolation, which led to new thinking about
          loneliness, and seeing how the practice of optogenetics (allowing
          scientists to turn neurons on and off in real time) can also change
          our thinking about social interaction. Through experimenting with
          these neurons in mice, researchers have been able to see neurons
          reacting to socialization. When the neurons are turned on, mice would
          seek out other mice, but when turned off, even isolated mice had no
          desire for social interaction. This can change our understanding of
          loneliness. Researcher Gillian Matthews explains “...there are
          mechanisms in place to help maintain social contact in the same way
          that there are mechanisms in place to make sure we maintain our food
          intake or our water intake” (Wired source). It’s as if social
          interaction is a fundamental need that our brains naturally seek out.
          Optogenetics is too invasive for human brains, so researcher Livia
          Tomova isolated human volunteers and then took fMRI scans of their
          brains. When shown photos of social cues, “...the regions of their
          brains associated with cravings lit up with activity in the same way
          that the brains of hungry people lit up when they were shown pictures
          of food” (Wired source). When our brains anticipate a certain
          activity, like social interaction, these neurons activate, and when we
          don’t get to participate in that activity, we experience a negative
          feeling. This would help explain the negative consequences of
          long-term isolation, where the neurons activate in anticipation of
          socialization, but don’t get it, it’s like starving in a sense.

        <h2>Objectophilia</h2>
        <p>
          This brings us to the topic of connections with inanimate/non-human
          objects and things. People who hold sexual or romantic attraction
          towards inanimate objects are called objectophiliacs, and are often
          made fun of in the media, but we can look at this to expand on the
          idea of love and how these object relationships come about Dasha
          Yildirim, who makes high-end porcelain dolls, knows a fair amount
          about this topic. The dolls are meant to be cared for, and people love
          them for a couple different reasons: Aesthetic love, because they’re
          poseable and customizable, basically a value based love, and the
          second reason? The dolls feel real, make people feel less lonely.
          Combined with aesthetic love, they are a reflection of the owner. Sad
          when you’re sad, or happy when you’re happy (Genki Ferguson,
          objectophilia). “People love objects because they reflect what we
          value in ourselves” (Genki Ferguson, objectophilia) We can think about
          this to expand on the idea of love. Romantic and sexual relationships
          are only a small amount of the connections we form, but the main
          definition of objectophilia only seems to focus on those and exclude
          platonic, aesthetic and even familial love. “We don’t love objects
          despite them not being human. We love them precisely because they
          aren’t human” (Genki Ferguson, objectophilia). When connecting with
          other people feels difficult, it might be normal to turn to objects or
          other things. Thinking of Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs, connection is
          right in the middle. We are social creatures, it makes sense that we’d
          want to reach out for any connection, or that we feel worse if we’re
          alone for long periods of time. Some people seek out a type of
          connection that they can’t seem to find within other humans.

        <h2>Romance and AI</h2>
        <p>
          What about AI? Could we form deeper relationships with AI, beyond
          romantic or sexual? Would we just be reflecting ourselves onto the AI
          we try to communicate with? If the AI could grow and change and
          respond differently to human inputs, making it more dynamic and
          advanced, the thought of connecting with it might be more exciting
          than with other objects or things. One day, AI might be developed to a
          point where it does resemble its own entity, perhaps something like
          the movie “Her” where people could have more complex relationships
          with AI technology It’s crazy to think about, but we can also see how
          it would be exciting to a certain extent. We should hope that humans
          would still be social, and moreover choose to be social with other
          humans, rather than AI technology, but for those who do seek non-human
          connections, AI could be the perfect opportunity to do just that. It
          could be a great tool to help those people cope ro express themselves
          however they choose. Overall, this is a complex situation, but
          realistic nonetheless. People will seek connections in a variety of
          ways, whether we see its real/justified (from an outside perspective)
          is besides the point. More advanced and complex AI is going to happen,
          whether or not we want it to, so it’s good to be more prepared or
          think about the future in this way. It will be interesting to explore
          how people can interact and form relationships with and love AI in the
          future.

      <h2>Objectification and Algorithmic Bias</h2>
      <p>
        Objectification frequently occurs when people are portrayed in media and
        advertising in a way that emphasizes their physical beauty, frequently
        at the expense of their other traits. These depictions reinforce
        unrealistic beauty standards, creating problems with body image.
        Specifically within patriarchal societies, women are very often reduced
        down to their physical attributes, leading to their worth being measured
        off of how best they are able to fit within these unrealistic beauty
        standards. This same act of reducing worth enables patriarchal systems
        to reinforce ideas of control and ownership of the individual agencies
        of women. With the introduction of social media and pornography, these
        expectations have become extended into intimate relations, negatively
        impacting self-image of sexual performance and body image.
      </p>
      <p>
        Algorithmic Bias is also another factor to consider when deconstructing
        digital intimacy. Algorithms generally rely on historical data and user
        behaviors, so if the data reflects bias, the algorithms themselves may
        also reflect and further perpetuate that same bias. Algorithms can also
        begin to limit diverse representations if they are built to prioritize
        content that conforms to oversimplified representations of current
        norms. Because these alrogrithms are designed to keep users engaged
        through prioritiizing individualized content by creating online personas
        per user, “filter bubbles” can be created, and users will have limited
        exposures to different content/perspectives.
      </p>

      <p>
        AI models designed to be “companions” will inherit biased data and
        reflect these stereotypes. Users will most likely be able to “choose”
        the physical appearance and personality types of these companions,
        further normalizing stereotypes and condensing down rich cultural
        backgrounds and complex human emotions. People with traits possessed by
        less desired AI companion types are bound to also suffer from body
        dysmorphia and lose confidence in their own self identity.
